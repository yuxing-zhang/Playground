# Quicksort in Multiple Languages
Quicksort is my de facto "Hello, World!" program for a given programming
language. Quicksort suits this purpose because it is conceptually simple,
yet it demonstrates the
* control flows (conditional/looping)
* elemental data structures (list)
* recursive function calls

of the language.

### Usage
**C**

Compile with `clang -o qsort qsort.c` and run with `./qsort`.

**Haskell**

Compile with `ghc qsort.c` and run with `./qsort`.
The Haskell implementation currently takes as input a sequence constant.

**Python**

Run with `python3 qsort.py`.

**Bash**

Run with `bash qsort.sh` or `./qsort.sh`.

**PL/pgSQL**

Execute the commands in psql with `\i qsort.sql`.
